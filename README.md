# Objective
Develop a data driven solution that ingests USA accident records, transforms them into an interactive Power BI dashboard, and delivers actionable insights for policymakers and transport planners. The model quantifies casualty burdens, pinpoints high risk road types, highlights seasonal patterns, and guides interventions that reduce crashes, injuries, and costs nationwide.

# Overview
The project blends accident data with contextual attributes such as road geometry, weather, time and traffic controls to build a star schema model in Excel Power Pivot. KPI cards, heat maps and slicers reveal 417 k casualties across 267 k incidents while DAX measures drive smart filters by severity, geography and time.

# Key Insights
1. Slight accidents form 85 percent of the 308 k events and 84 percent of casualties, yet serious and fatal cases still account for 16 percent of injuries.

2. Single carriageways host roughly three quarters of all crashes, more than double the total on any other road type.

3. Fridays record the highest weekday accident count, and November is the peak month, highlighting cyclical risk linked to winter driving and weekend travel.

4. Clear weather accompanies almost eight in ten collisions, showing that driver behaviour, not adverse conditions, is the dominant factor.

5. Uncontrolled T‑style junctions and 30 mph zones register the greatest number of incidents, signalling a need for improved traffic control and speed management.

# Conclusions & Recommendations

1. Prioritise upgrades on single carriageway stretches with enhanced lighting, signage and lane separation.

2. Target enforcement and safety campaigns on Fridays and during November when accidents spike.

3. Launch behaviour focused programmes to curb speeding and distraction, since most crashes occur in good weather.

4. Install signals or roundabouts at busy T junctions and audit 30 mph zones for compliance.

5. Maintain continuous dashboard monitoring with MAPE alerts to track intervention ROI and refine safety measures quickly.
